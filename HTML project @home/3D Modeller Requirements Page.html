	<h3>3D modellers do not necessarily have any educational requirements. Those hiring someone as a 3D modeller will more likely look at your skill level
	(your ability to produce quality work, the look of what you made, artistic capabilities, etc.),people you have worked with and some models you have made.
	Those hiring will look mostly for a type of model/art that they need. In some cases it is recommended that some sort of educational background is there.
	3D modelling is used in many different industries including film, science and geology, gaming and architecture. The education required to become a 3D 
	modeller differs upon which industry one wishes to work in. A four year degree in the field related to the type 3D modelling that you are pursuing. 
	Someone who wishes to work in the scientific area related to 3D modelling should focus on a degree that combines physics and 3D modelling for example.
	Those wanting a career as a 3D modeller should earn at least a bachelor's degree to ensure their career will be safer. </h3>
