	<h2>Daily Life Of A 3D Modeller</h2>
	<h3>The daily life of a freelance/self-employed 3D modeller would be different and it would be done as per the person's needs and wants. 
	A freelance/self-employed person would have their own plans that will cater to their customers and who they work for. For those working as 
	a 3D modeller professionally, they are often apart of a larger work team who are working to create projects like a film or advertisement. 
	They usually work in an office building or agency. There day would start fairly early so that everyone could get the needed notes for what
	they were to work on for the rest of the day. After the notes are given out, the person in charge would give everyone a specific part that 
	they are to work on and that's what the 3D modeller will do.
